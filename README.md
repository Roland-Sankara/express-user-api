## Software testing;
The process of checking the;
- quality, 
- functionality, 
- and performance 
of a software product before launching/deployment

## Why it's done;
Software testing is done to see; 
- if business logic is fulfilled, 
- or if there are any missing gaps in requirements that need immediate tackles. 

**Without it, app-breaking bugs that can negatively impact the app may go undetected.**

## How it's done..
To do software testing, testers either;
- interact with the software manually 
- or execute test scripts 
to find bugs and errors, ensuring that the software works as expected.

## Types of Software Testing
- Functional;
    * verifies whether app delivers expected output
- Non-Functional;
    * Verifies whether the non-functional aspects work as expected (e.g stability, usability, security)

## Types of Functional Testing
- Unit Testing;
    * Test individual unit of the app
- Integration Testing
    * Test whether group of units work well together
- Acceptance Testing
    * Test app against real life secenarios

## Types of Non-Functional testing
- Security Testing (Authorized access etc)
- Performance Testing (Speed, Stability, Resource Usage)
- Load testing (handle expected & peak loads)
- Usability
- Compatibility

# integration tests with Supertest
- 

```js
/**
 * CHALLENGE
 * 1. Goal: Test login failure
 *    - Create "Should not login non-existent user" test case
 *        > make a request with bad /Invalid credentials
 *    - expect the correct status code/reponse to be returned
 *    - Run the test.
 * 
 * 2. Goal: Test user account deleted by authenticated user
 *    - Create "Should delete account for user" test case
 *        > Setup auth header and expect correcr status code/response to be returned
 *    - Create "Should not delete account by unauthenticated user"
 *        > Expect correct status code to be returned
 *    - Run the tests
